# Post box design implementation challenge

## Prompt
Given the `index.html`, `main.css`, and `main.js` files within this folder, implement the included UX designs found in `design.jpg` as closely as possible.

## Hints
Feel free to change or remove any files or code that we've included. You are especially encouraged to modify the main post box template found in `index.html` to suit your needs.

You should be able to work through the entire implementation without working in `main.js`, but it may be helpful to look at the comments in the file to understand what is going on.

## Success
A successful implementation will look similar (or the same) as the designs, and will have the correct UX interactions as specified. These should be:

    #. When the user loads the page, the post box should be minimized
    #. When the user clicks into the post box, the submit button should appear and the post box should expand
    #. When the user clicks submit, the post box should be replaced with the submitted text and a "Success" message should appear
    #. The user should be able to click "Start Over" to return to the first step
